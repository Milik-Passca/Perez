# Python3 program to find simple interest 
# for given principal amount, time and 
# rate of interest

# We can change values here for 
# diiferent inputs

P=2000
R=3
T=2.5

# Calculate simple interest

SI = (P* R* T)/100

# Print the resultant value of 

print ("simple interest is", SI)
